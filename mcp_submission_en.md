### 🧠 Adaptive Orchestration and Semantic Memory

| Name | Description | Notes |
| :--- | :---------- | :---- |
| [CHANGELY/solo-mcp](https://github.com/CHANGELY/solo-mcp) | An intelligent MCP server with adaptive learning and vector search. It provides smart orchestration, context awareness, semantic search, and knowledge accumulation. | Community implementation, Python 🐍, Local 🏠, Production-grade ⚡ |

Key Features:
- 🧠 Smart Orchestration: Automatically selects optimal tool combinations for efficient task execution
- 📚 Adaptive Learning: Learns from usage patterns to continuously improve recommendations
- 🔍 Vector Search: Semantic similarity search for highly relevant results
- ⚡ High Performance: Optimized filesystem operations and memory management
- 🔧 Production-grade: Comprehensive test coverage and stability

Tools:
- Filesystem: robust file operations, search, and management
- Memory: semantic search, knowledge storage and retrieval
- Adaptive Learning: user preference learning and tool recommendation
- Context Awareness: decision making based on history and environment

Installation:
```bash
pip install solo-mcp[full]  # full version with vector search
pip install solo-mcp        # core version only
```

Configuration Example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "solo-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "solo_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ENABLE_VECTOR_SEARCH": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use Cases:
- Complex tasks requiring intelligent orchestration
- Knowledge management with semantic search
- Systems that benefit from adaptive learning
- Production environments demanding stability and performance
