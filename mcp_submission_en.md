| [CHANGELY/solo-mcp](https://github.com/CHANGELY/solo-mcp) | Trae Solo Mode Enhancement - An intelligent MCP server with adaptive learning, vector search, and task management. It provides smart orchestration, context awareness, semantic search, knowledge accumulation, and Todo management. | Community implementation, Python 🐍, Local 🏠, Production-grade ⚡ |

Key Features:
- 🧠 Smart Orchestration: Automatically selects optimal tool combinations for efficient task execution
- 📚 Adaptive Learning: Learns from usage patterns to continuously improve recommendations
- 🔍 Vector Search: Semantic similarity search for highly relevant results
- 📝 Todo Management: Complete task management system with priority, status, and dependency tracking
- ⚡ High Performance: Optimized filesystem operations and memory management
- 🔧 Production-grade: Comprehensive test coverage and stability

Tools:
- Filesystem: robust file operations, search, and management
- Memory: semantic search, knowledge storage and retrieval
- Adaptive Learning: user preference learning and tool recommendation
- Context Awareness: decision making based on history and environment
- Todo Management: task creation, updates, deletion, search, and analytics

Installation:
```bash
pip install solo-mcp[full]  # full version with vector search
pip install solo-mcp        # core version only
```

Configuration Example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "solo-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "solo_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ENABLE_VECTOR_SEARCH": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use Cases:
- Complex tasks requiring intelligent orchestration
- Knowledge management with semantic search
- Systems that benefit from adaptive learning
- Project management and collaborative task tracking
- Production environments demanding stability and performance
